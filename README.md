# Prediction of Housing Prices using Regression Models and Artificial Neural Networks

The project aims to predict the sales prices of residential properties using a dataset provided by a Kaggle competition. Accurate house price predictions are crucial for buyers, sellers, real estate agencies, and financial institutions, as they inform pricing strategies, investment decisions, and loan risk assessments. This project aims to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual house prices by leveraging advanced regression models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, as well as a Multi-Layer Perceptron deep learning model.
